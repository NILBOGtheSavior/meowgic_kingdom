# Meowgic Kingdom

<img src="assets/icon.png" width=250>

Welcome to **Meowgic Kingdom** — a 2D turn-based RPG where kittens harness ancient arcane powers, scale to god-tier strength, and face off against the tyrannical **Lion King** who rules the land with fire and fluff.

This is a solo indie dev project being built in Godot 4 with ❤️, claws, and a borderline unhealthy amount of coffee. The goal? A modular, expandable RPG experience with tactical combat, dungeon-crawling, and way too many puns.
